# ## Project Proposal

# ## Abstract:
# Climate change is one of the biggest issues faced by the modern world. Transitioning to sustainable energy sources is the need of the hour to avoid future catastrophic events. China is leading the world in this transition and accounted for fourty one percent of all electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2020. America is also partaking in the EV revolution lead by Tesla. According to the Annual Budget, Biden Administration aims to build 500,000 Electric vehicle charging stations across America by 2030. EV vehicles in the US get a tax credit of $7500 on average. Tesla- market leader in the luxury EV segment plans to expand to 15000 supercharger stations by 2030 with over 200,000 charging points pan America. It will be safe to assume that other private electric car manufacturers will also expand their network to meet consumer demand. California will ban ICE vehicles by 2030 and plans to build 300,000 charging stations in the next ten years. This sector will most likely see alot of public-private partnerships in the coming decades

# ## Problem:
#  To help my client choose appropriate EV charging locations in New York, that makes them strategic advantage over competitors. 

# ## Impact Hypothesis:
# To help select EV charging station locations across New York, with an intent to maximize utility and build partnerships with third party providers, in case of non-availability of commercial space at strategic locations. 
# 
# ## Measures of Success:
# 1) Technical: Build a model that effectively predicts areas with increased usage to assist decision making in EV charging station installation
# 
# 2) Non-Technical: Month-on-month growth in Utility of individual charging stations.
